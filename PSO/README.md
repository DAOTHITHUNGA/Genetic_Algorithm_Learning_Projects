# Particle Swarm Optimization
In this experiment, four functions are chosen to test the performance of PSO with 2 dimension (Eggholder, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock and Ackley) and 10 dimension (Rastrigin and Rosenbrock).

## Requirements
To run, these following packages should be installed:
```
ImageMagick 6.9.7-4
matplotlib 3.3.2
Python 3.6.9
Numpy 1.19.2
```
Missing packages should be installed at ease using pip3 or conda.

## Run

> Run *experiment.sh* 

* plot the animations (gifs) for 2 dimension problem (run_plot.py)
* run experiment on 10 dimension problem (run1.py)
* do ttest on 10 dimension problem to compare between Ring and Star topology (run.py)
